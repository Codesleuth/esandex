esendex-sandbox
=
A lightweight sandbox implementation of the [Esendex][esendex] REST API, providing request and response schema validation with example response behaviour and content. Currently all examples are taken from the [official REST API documentation][esendex-rest-api], with the goal of eventually adding sandboxed features that modify these example responses for expected scenarios.
